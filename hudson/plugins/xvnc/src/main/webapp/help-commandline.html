  Configure the Xvnc command line to invoke. Leave it empty to let Hudson figures things out.
  <br>
  Xvnc must be installed on the system
  <br>
  A typical option looks like "<tt>/path/to/vncserver :$DISPLAY_NUMBER -geometry 800x600</tt>"
  See <a href="http://www.realvnc.com/products/free/4.1/man/vncserver.html">the man page</a>
  for more details. Hudson remembers what display numbers are in use, and when it launches
  a new vncserver process, it picks the available number and replace <tt>$DISPLAY_NUMBER</tt>
  by that number.
