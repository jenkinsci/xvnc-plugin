<div>
  Maximum X display number to use when starting Xvnc. Leave it empty to let Hudson figures things out.
  <br>
  Default is 99. A random display number will be chosen between minimum and maximum given, inclusive. Use a number only, don't prepend the colon (:).
  Note that some vnc viewers interepret the display numbers above 99 as socket port numbers and leave out offseting with 5900.
